"""EDA-agnostic tools: the main flows, backend-independent.

These are the same operation whichever EDA is active -- they pull a normalized
snapshot from the active backend (Altium or KiCad) and run shared logic on it.
An optional ``backend`` argument targets a specific tool when the server runs in
``both`` mode. Failures report ``{"ok": False, "reason": ...}`` (the offline
error family).
